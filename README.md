WIM Assignment - 2 : Restaurant UI

Aim
The aim of this experiment is to develop a user interface (UI) for a restaurant, specifically focusing on creating an engaging and visually appealing webpage that showcases various dishes and restaurant information. The goal is to utilize HTML and CSS to design a responsive and attractive layout that enhances user experience.

Theory

1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is the standard language used to create and design web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage through the use of elements and tags.
Key HTML Elements Used:
<head>: Contains meta-information about the HTML document, including links to stylesheets and favicon icons.
<body>: Holds the visible content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
<section>: Defines sections in a webpage, which can be styled separately.
<div>: Used as a container to group and style other elements.
<img>: Embeds images into the webpage, crucial for displaying restaurant dishes.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is used to control the presentation and layout of HTML elements. It allows for styling and designing of the webpage, including colors, fonts, and spacing.
Key CSS Features Used:
Flexbox and Grid Layouts:
Flexbox: Provides a flexible layout structure that allows elements to be aligned and spaced evenly within a container. Useful for creating responsive designs.
Grid: Allows for the creation of complex grid-based layouts. Enables precise control over the placement and alignment of elements.
Animations:
CSS animations are used to create dynamic effects, such as fading in elements, sliding animations, and zooming effects. They enhance the visual appeal and user interaction.
Backgrounds and Images:
CSS properties such as background-image, background-size, and background-position are used to style backgrounds and images, ensuring they fit well within the design.
Media Queries:
Media queries allow the design to adapt to different screen sizes and devices, making the webpage responsive and accessible.
